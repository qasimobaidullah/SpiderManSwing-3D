# **Spidey Swinger**  
## Overview  

This project is a third-person character controller developed in Unity, featuring dynamic swinging, climbing, and movement mechanics. It offers an immersive experience where players can swing between objects, climb walls, and perform standard ground movement actions such as running and jumping.  

## Features  

- **Swinging Mechanics:**  
  Swing between objects using webs for seamless traversal.

- **Animations:** Integrated with Mixamo's pre-made animation assets for smooth character movements.  

- **Animator (State Machine):** Utilises state parameters to handle transitions between animation states for locomotion, swing, climb etc.
